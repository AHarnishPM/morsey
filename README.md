# Morse-Code-Translator
Hey!

This is my Morse code translator project. I'm mainly using it as a learning tool to get a better understanding of open-source code and proper Python coding practices.
When I first wrote this, it was 300 lines of if-else statements in Python 2. My goal is to turn it into something actually usable and readable.
Any suggestions for how to format my code better or comments on general glaring issues in my use of GitHub would be greatly appreciated!

Currently, the morse.py file runs and prompts the user to input Morse code or English as a string, which it then translates to the other and prints as a string.

Runs on Python 3.9
